# deckofcards
Hello, and thanks for looking at my code! :)

I made the following assumption when programming this:
* I assumed that it was fine if dealOneCard() returns the 'top' card, which in this case is the last item in the array. I chose the last index because it saves on having to shift all the elements down in the array when the card is removed.

Thanks again!
